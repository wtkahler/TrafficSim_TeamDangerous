# TrafficSim_TeamDangerous
Repo for UWB Computer Simulations course. Traffic simulation system.

As of now, the system is mostly a structural model of the freeway system. Tracking of cars behind, ahead, and behind and ahead from upper and lower lanes still needs to be implemented.

run with `python3 Main.py` or through Canopy. As of now there are mainly 4 variables to manipulate at the beginning of the file, but this is still evolving heavily.
